## Task done ##
1. Installation file
2. Definition of the problem
3. Sketch for the system

## Questions/ to do ##
Are we going to contain all the files for this project in one big file?

## What I learned ##
I have learned how to create files in the desktop using bash script.
Also got to learn how to sketch a system before coding the program


## Reflection ##
4.1.6 is Identify the condition associated with a given decision in a specified problem. 4.2.4 is Analyse an algorithm presented as a flow chart. both these topics are related to the car rent program and it will help the maker to create the program easily. We explore 4.1.6 to decide which coding methods are easier for the user to use. and we by identifying the condition why we chose some decision over other rely more on how simple the progrram need to be. For 4.2.4, we made a flow diagram for the coding that we going to use for the rental car program. We did this because we need to put into flow diagram before making the program which can help us make decisions and make the process of making the program easier. Today we finished making frame for the words that we going to use for our program and this is helpful because it makes our program more fancier than it suppose to be. I learn how to make the frame of the word and how to keep the frame to not change no matter the length of the word.

## What has worked for me in class so far? ##
I think doing different activities in class worked for me and how the teacher comes to students to help them when they need help. Also having a warm-up at the begining of every class help me a lot because I got to practice previous lessons. 

## What skills have I developed? ## 
In my opinion, I think I developed a mentality of thinking about a program before programming it and also thinking about the easiest way of coding that program. I think, I have also develop the skill of explaining a program to other people in a way that they understand and use my code again. 

## changes for Computer Science ##
I wouldn't change anything from Computer Science class but I would like to suggest to add more fun activities. I remember the first  day that I had this class, we did a mini-challenge between the students where we had to cipher a coding and solve other stuff. Those kind of activities would make the class more enjoyable and help students study more.
