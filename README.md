### Definition of the problem
A car rental office wants to buy a computer program that can record all their information about their cars. This Program will help the clients to record the car that they took and how long their trip was and the history of the car for all its trips. They require the program to be simple so that it wouldnâ€™t confuse the users and the owners of the company. For the program to be simple, it needs to contain simple commands which can be used by anyone without needing any instructions from the program designer. This program needs to be delivered to the company in the simplest way possible. Every time that they use their program, all their data need to be saved so that they could recall it later for more information. This program will store all their data which makes them keep track of their financial system.
