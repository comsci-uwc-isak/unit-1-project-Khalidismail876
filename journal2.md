4.1.6 is Identify the condition associated with a given decision in a specified problem.
4.2.4 is 	Analyse an algorithm presented as a flow chart.
both these topics are related to the car rent program and it will help the maker to create the program easily.
We explore 4.1.6 to decide which coding methods are easier for the user to use. 
and we by identifying the condition why we chose some decision over other rely more on how simple the progrram need to be. 
For 4.2.4, we made a flow diagram for the coding that we going to use for the rental car program. 
We did this because we need to put into flow diagram before making the program which can help us make decisions and make the 
process of making the program easier. 
Today we finished making frame for the words that we going to use for our program
and this is helpful because it makes our program more fancier than it suppose to be.
I learn how to make the frame of the word and how to keep the frame to not change no matter the length of the word.
